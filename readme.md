# Haskell Programming from First Principles

This is just a repo for my work on the exercises in the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/authors.html) as I am trying to teach myself programming via Haskell.

In 2015 I spent a few months working with Javascript as a first approach to programming and felt like the syntax and environment were holding me back and my conceptual understanding was advancing much faster than my practical understanding. Haskell meshes much more with the way I think and the syntax and environment really allow conceptual and practical understanding to grow in sync. I'm trying to spend about 2 hours a day working with Haskell, primarily with this book, and so far I am really loving the brain bending.

All the exercises here of course belong to the authors, and since their book is still under development, exercise solutions may be inaccurate by the time you see this. I only have exercises from the end of Chapter 8 onward included here.
